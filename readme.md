# ErgoDox EZ Jaye's Layout

Colemak base.  Toggles to Qwerty.  Designed with Mac OS in mind; uses Mac-specific media keys where applicable, and makes the command key easily accesible with either pinky.

Dedicated mouse layer.

Media and F-keys layer.

Makes extensive use of "tap for standard key-press, hold to activate modifier"-behaviour.
